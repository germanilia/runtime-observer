# Runtime Observer

Runtime Observer is a lightweight telemetry contract, Python/JavaScript SDK, and local collector dashboard for understanding application runtime behavior: routes, traces, logs, exceptions, dependency calls, metrics, background jobs, tools, and LLM usage.

## Repository layout

- `python-sdk/` — importable `runtime_observer` SDK and instrumentation helpers.
- `collector/` — FastAPI collector and local HTML dashboard backed by SQLite or PostgreSQL.
- `schemas/` — shared JSON Schema contract plus validated event examples.
- `examples/python-fastapi-minimal/` — minimal FastAPI app instrumented with the SDK.
- `docs/` — integration, architecture, API, deployment, and development notes.

## Quick start

```bash
just init
just test
just run
```

Open the collector dashboard at `http://127.0.0.1:4319/`. `just run` uses live reload and frees port 4319 before starting so repeated local runs are predictable. The first dashboard login creates the admin user; later logins require that username/password. After login, the dashboard opens on project selection; choose a project to inspect its apps, routes, traces, logs, dependencies, activity metrics, and generated SDK API keys.

To install directly from GitHub without cloning:

```bash
python -m pip install \
  'runtime-observer @ git+https://github.com/germanilia/runtime-observer.git#subdirectory=python-sdk'
python -m pip install \
  'runtime-observer-server @ git+https://github.com/germanilia/runtime-observer.git#subdirectory=collector'
```

The same URLs work with `uv pip install`. For browser or Node.js apps, install the JavaScript SDK directly from GitHub:

```bash
npm install runtime-observer@github:germanilia/runtime-observer
```

Use `runtime-observer/browser` in frontend bundles and `runtime-observer/node` in backend services. For older installs, replace `runtime-observer-browser` with `runtime-observer` in `package.json` and run `npm install`.

See [`docs/integration.md`](docs/integration.md) for full setup and examples.

## Metrics and code-level enrichment

Runtime Observer supports both automatic instrumentation and deliberate code injection into the application code path. Add small SDK calls where the base code has the business context you care about:

```python
with observer.start_span("calculate quote", kind="function", attributes={"cart_size": len(cart.items)}):
    quote = calculate_quote(cart)

observer.emit("metric_counter", {"name": "orders.created", "value": 1, "attributes": {"channel": "web"}})
```

Use this for metrics that automatic HTTP/database/LLM instrumentation cannot infer: business counters, queue/job lifecycle events, tool calls, feature usage, and important function boundaries. The shared schema also accepts `function_called`, `function_returned`, `background_job_started`, `background_job_finished`, and `tool_call` events for deeper manual enrichment.

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and replace placeholder secrets for non-local use.

Important settings:

- `RUNTIME_OBSERVER_SECRETS` — path to `secrets.yml`; the database connection string lives there.
- `RUNTIME_OBSERVER_DATABASE_URL` — override the database URL directly (SQLite path or `postgres://…` URL); takes precedence over `secrets.yml`.
- `RUNTIME_OBSERVER_ENDPOINT` — SDK collector base URL, for example `http://127.0.0.1:4319`.
- `RUNTIME_OBSERVER_PROJECT_NAME` — project shown on the post-login project selection screen. **Required** for SDK export to be enabled.
- `RUNTIME_OBSERVER_SERVICE_NAME` — app/service name inside the project.
- `RUNTIME_OBSERVER_API_KEY` — project SDK key generated in the dashboard and stored hashed in the DB.
- `RUNTIME_OBSERVER_INSECURE_DEV` — disables auth only for local development.
- `RUNTIME_OBSERVER_RETENTION_DAYS` — days of raw event data to keep (default `7`). Also configurable via `PUT /api/settings`.
- `RUNTIME_OBSERVER_RETENTION_MIN_LOG_MINUTES` — minimum recency window for logs preserved during cleanup (default `60`).
- `RUNTIME_OBSERVER_RETENTION_EXCEPTION_WINDOW_MINUTES` — logs within this window around an exception are pinned during cleanup (default `180`).

## Documentation

- [`docs/integration.md`](docs/integration.md) — GitHub installation, collector setup, FastAPI/logging/dependency/browser ingestion, manual code-level enrichment, dashboard usage, preferences, and troubleshooting.
- [`docs/api.md`](docs/api.md) — ingestion, dashboard, query, and agent tool APIs.
- [`docs/deployment.md`](docs/deployment.md) — local process, Docker Compose, EC2 deployment, and security checklist.

## Commands

- `just init` — install editable packages and configure hooks.
- `just test` — run SDK, collector, and schema tests.
- `just test-smoke` — validation run used by the pre-push hook.
- `just run` — run the local collector with live reload on port 4319, killing any existing listener on that port first.
- `just run-collector` — alias for `just run`.
- `just run-example` — run the minimal FastAPI example.
- `just deploy-ec2 [ENVIRONMENT]` — deploy the collector to EC2 behind an ALB (default environment: `sela`).
- `just setup-hooks` — configure `.githooks/pre-push`.

## Git hooks

After cloning, run:

```bash
just setup-hooks
```

The pre-push hook runs smoke tests, generates `.git/git-reports/pre-push-latest.html`, and asks Claude to review blockers and update docs when needed. If docs are changed by the hook, review and commit them before pushing again.
